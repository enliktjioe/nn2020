    "# Microsoft COCO\n",
    "For this exercise we will use the 2014 release of the [Microsoft COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/) which has become the standard testbed for image captioning. The dataset consists of 80,000 training images and 40,000 validation images, each annotated with 5 captions written by workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step you should download the data from http://cs231n.stanford.edu/coco_captioning.zip to `../datasets` directory and unzip it. Warning: the COCO data download is ~1GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have preprocessed the data and extracted features for you already. For all images we have extracted features from the fc7 layer of the VGG-16 network pretrained on ImageNet; these features are stored in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7.h5` respectively. To cut down on processing time and memory requirements, we have reduced the dimensionality of the features from 4096 to 512; these features can be found in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw images take up a lot of space (nearly 20GB) so we have not included them in the download. However all images are taken from Flickr, and URLs of the training and validation images are stored in the files `train2014_urls.txt` and `val2014_urls.txt` respectively. This allows you to download images on the fly for visualization. Since images are downloaded on-the-fly, **you must be connected to the internet to view images**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with strings is inefficient, so we will work with an encoded version of the captions. Each word is assigned an integer ID, allowing us to represent a caption by a sequence of integers. The mapping between integer IDs and words is in the file `coco2014_vocab.json`, and you can use the function `decode_captions` from the file `coco_utils.py` to convert numpy arrays of integer IDs back into strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple special tokens that we add to the vocabulary. We prepend a special `<START>` token and append an `<END>` token to the beginning and end of each caption respectively. Rare words are replaced with a special `<UNK>` token (for \"unknown\"). In addition, since we want to train with minibatches containing captions of different lengths, we pad short captions with a special `<NULL>` token after the `<END>` token and don't compute loss or gradient for `<NULL>` tokens. Since they are a bit of a pain, we have taken care of all implementation details around special tokens for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can load all of the MS-COCO data (captions, features, URLs, and vocabulary) using the `load_coco_data` function from the file `coco_utils.py`. Run the following cell to do so:"

    "# RNN for image captioning\n",
    "\n",
    "The image captioning model has two input branches - the image and text (because text generation depends on the previous word). Image features are passed through the Dense layer to produce initial hidden state for the RNN. Then the RNN walks over the input text and predicts next word at every step. We are using text as input to provide known correct previous words during training, this is called \"teacher forcing\". During test time we feed the output from previous step as input to the next step. Output of the network is probability distribution over vocabulary words. During test time we sample from this distribution. Usual categorical cross-entropy loss is used with Adam optimizer."
